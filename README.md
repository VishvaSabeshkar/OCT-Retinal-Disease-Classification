# RetinaNet-OCT
RetinaNet-OCT is an automated medical imaging solution designed to detect and classify retinal diseases from Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) scans. Utilizing deep learning, the project categorizes images into four distinct classes: Choroidal Neovascularization (CNV), Diabetic Macular Edema (DME), Drusen, and Normal retinal structures.
